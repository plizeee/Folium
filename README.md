# folium

This fork of Folium is aimed to redesign the UI and provide some quality of life improvements.

## Where's all the stuff you showed off on Reddit/Discord?

I previously had a version with much more features, but this is my first project that involves UI or Swift, so I decided to start over in order to clean up my messy code, using the most recent version of Folium.

## What does this version offer?

### General
* Based on Folium v1.2
* Less intrusive button style (hollow and always partially transparent)
* Button press animations
* L/R placed on either side of the A button (much easier to press)
* Buttons hopefully shouldn't overlap with the touch screen (need testing)

### Cytrus
* Circular thumbstick boundaries (rather than square)
* Visible thumbstick boundaries while moving the thumbsticks
* Fully hide dpad while moving left thumbstick, same with right thumbstick for abxy
* ZL/ZR place on either size of the dpad up button (I put it there because those buttons aren't used as much)

### Grape
* Screens waste less space in portrait and landscape mode
* Physical controller thumbsticks now behave as dpad buttons
* Physical controller triggers now behave as shoulder buttons

## What's next?

### General
* Re-add dropdown menu UI
* Re-add ability to make any button toggle
* Re-add ability to make any button turbo
* Re-add volume controls
* Re-add button to toggle between dpad and joystick
* Re-add button to hide all UI buttons
* Re-add game-specific custom controls
* Re-add secondary screen transparency effect (need to investigate more efficient solutions)
* Re-add secondary screen automatic fade effect

## I have a suggestion!
* I'm open to suggestions! Leave suggestions here or wherever I upload demos!
* Keep in mind, I'm still relatively inexperienced, so try to be realistic.
* Changes related to the core are usually outside the scope of this project.
